# Router Structure

The routers are structured in the `src/routers` directory.  Each router is a file that exports a Hono router.  The router is then mounted in the `src/app.ts` file.

# Router Files

Each router file should be named after the resource it is for.  For example, the `users.ts` file should be for the `users` resource.

# Router Functions

For now we are going to write the database queries directly in the router files.

# Validation
We must *always* validate the request parameters and body using Zod.  We should use the `zValidator` function to do this.
